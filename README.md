Airbnb is an American San Francisco-based company operating an online marketplace for short-term homestays and experiences. It started at 2008 and nowdays shares a non ignorable percentage of the respective market worldwide. More and more people provide a flat or house to the platform. It is a sustainable source of money. 

My motivation for this project was to predict the prices of the airbnb and find the important features. The dataset has been taken by kaggle and from the link below I only take weekdays file:

I have uploaded the jupyter notebook and the respective pdf file. 

Inside the project you will find exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis, correlations between the target column and the other features as well as only between continuous features and what I used for the regression in order to predict the prices and the features importance. 


The libraries that I used:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- folium
- Geopandas
